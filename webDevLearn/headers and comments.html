        <h2>Html helps/is how we format docs for web consumption</h2>
        <h3>So we have different kinds of headers</h3>
        <h4>That get smaller all the way up to 6</h4>
        <h5>Which is really just like.. </h5>
        <h6>Bold text</h6>

        <p>We can also have horizontal lines:</p>
        <hr />
        <p> Another empty tag.... maybe use css for a nicer experience though</p>
        <!--And these are multi line comments....
        These are multi line by default. Nice for keeping your code readable and clarifying things.
        Always strive to write great and clean code.-->
